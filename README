Compares the two selected colors by their luminosity. The program is looped so you can select and compare a lot of colors

* Needs `gpick` to be installed (which is a color picking utility for Linux) and available in the `PATH` environment variable (to be invokable through `subprocess.run`)
* Run `comparator.py` (`python3 comparator.py`)
* To exit, exit from `gpick` when it appears (by default it's done with the "Escape" key)
* Modes are provided using the first argument to the program (`python3 comparator.py MODE`)
* The default mode is "old_new"

AVAILABLE MODES:
* "old_new": loop { query for old color -> query for new color -> output difference }
* "only_new": query for old color -> loop { query for new color -> output difference }
